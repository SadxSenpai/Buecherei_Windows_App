## Technologies Used

This project leverages modern tools to build a performant and maintainable Windows Forms application:

* **Programming Language**: C#
* **Framework**: .NET 7
* **GUI**: Windows Forms
* **Database**: MySQL
* **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
* **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022

---

## Architecture and Structure

The application uses a modular design where each major feature (e.g., books, users, borrowings) is encapsulated in its own `UserControl`. The `MainForm` acts as the container, dynamically loading the appropriate control into its central panel based on user navigation.

This approach enables:

* Clear separation of concerns
* Better maintainability
* Easier feature expansion

---

## User Interface

The UI is designed for simplicity and usability, and includes:

* **Login Window**: Secure login via username and password
* **Main Window**: Menu-driven navigation
* **Central Panel**: Dynamically shows selected features via UserControls

> Screenshots coming soon!

## Functionalities

### üîê Login

* Login via database query
* Password hashing using SHA-256
* Role-based access control (admin vs. employee)

### üìñ Book Management

* Add, edit, and delete book entries
* Book attributes: title, author, ISBN, category, and availability
* Search and filter books

### üë§ User Management

* Manage library users
* View borrowed books per user
* Create, edit, and delete users

### ‚úâÔ∏è Borrowing & Returning

* Select user and books to borrow
* Track borrowing status
* Manage returns and update availability

---

## Database Design

The database is designed for normalized, relational storage with core entities:

### Users Table

| Field        | Type   | Description         |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------- |
| ID (PK)      | int    | Primary key         |
| Username     | string | Login name          |
| PasswordHash | string | SHA-256 hashed pass |
| Role         | string | Access level        |

### Books Table

| Field      | Type   | Description       |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| ID (PK)    | int    | Primary key       |
| Title      | string | Book title        |
| Author     | string | Book author       |
| ISBN       | string | International ID  |
| Category   | string | Genre or category |
| IsBorrowed | bool   | Borrowed status   |

### LibraryUsers Table

| Field       | Type   | Description       |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| ID (PK)     | int    | Primary key       |
| FirstName   | string | User's first name |
| LastName    | string | User's last name  |
| Address     | string | Home address      |
| DateOfBirth | date   | Date of birth     |

### Borrowings Table

| Field         | Type   | Description            |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| ID (PK)       | int    | Primary key            |
| LibraryUserID | int FK | Foreign key to user    |
| BookID        | int FK | Foreign key to book    |
| BorrowDate    | date   | When borrowed          |
| ReturnDate    | date   | When returned (if any) |
| IsReturned    | bool   | Return status          |

---

## User Controls

Each module is represented as a `UserControl` for encapsulated logic:

* `UC_Login`: Handles secure authentication
* `UC_Home`: Default dashboard view
* `UC_Books`: Book list, search, and management
* `UC_Users`: Manage library users
* `UC_Borrowing`: Handle lending and returns
* `UC_Statistics` (planned): Data analytics and charts

---

## Security

* Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 and never stored in plain text
* Role-based access limits sensitive functions to admins
* Entity Framework Core reduces SQL injection risk

---

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Buecherei_Windows_App.git
   ```
2. **Set up the MySQL database** using the provided SQL script
3. **Edit `appsettings.json`** to match your database credentials
4. **Open in Visual Studio 2022**
5. **Build and run the solution**

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add statistics dashboard (most borrowed books, active users, etc.)
* Implement reminders for overdue returns
* Track multiple copies of the same book
* Enable email notifications for users
* Add report printing and exporting (PDF/Excel)
